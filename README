üìö About StudyZone: Your Focus Companion for YouTube!
Tired of getting lost in endless entertainment videos when you should be studying? The StudyZone Chrome Extension is here to help you reclaim your focus on YouTube! It intelligently guides you towards productive content and gently nudges you away from distractions.

Here's how StudyZone helps you stay on track:

üö´ Block YouTube Shorts: Automatically redirects you from those addictive Shorts videos straight back to the YouTube homepage. No more endless scrolling!

‚ö†Ô∏è Smart Entertainment Warnings: If you land on a YouTube video that looks like pure entertainment (based on a smart analysis of its title and description), a friendly popup will appear. It'll remind you of your study goals and give you a quick option to "Go Back to Study" (taking you to the YouTube homepage) or "Proceed Anyway" if you're truly done studying.

‚úÖ "Well Done" for Study Success: When you click on a video that perfectly matches your defined study keywords, you'll see a satisfying "Well done! You're in the StudyZone!" message. A little positive reinforcement goes a long way!

StudyZone is your personal tutor, helping you cultivate better study habits and make the most of your time on YouTube.

üöÄ Get Started: Install StudyZone for Free!
Since StudyZone is a community-driven project and not available on the official Chrome Web Store, you'll install it manually using Chrome's "Developer mode." Don't worry, it's a straightforward process!

Step 1: Download the Extension Files
Click here to download the latest version of StudyZone:
‚û°Ô∏è https://github.com/yash88990/StudyZone.zip/archive/refs/tags/v1.0.0.zip ‚¨ÖÔ∏è

Once downloaded, find the StudyZone.zip file on your computer (it's usually in your "Downloads" folder).

Unzip the StudyZone.zip file. This will create a new folder named StudyZone.zip-1.0.0 (or similar) containing all the extension's files.
üîë IMPORTANT: Remember the exact location of this unzipped folder! Chrome needs continuous access to these files for the extension to work. Please do not delete or move this folder after installation.

Step 2: Load the Extension in Google Chrome
Open your Google Chrome browser.

In the address bar at the top, type chrome://extensions and press Enter.

On the Extensions page, find the toggle switch in the top right corner labeled "Developer mode". Click this switch to turn it ON.
(Visual Aid: Look for a switch like this in the top right corner)

Once "Developer mode" is on, a new button will appear on the left side of the page: "Load unpacked". Click this button.
(Visual Aid: This button will appear after enabling Developer mode)

A file browser window will open. Navigate to and select the unzipped StudyZone folder you created in Step 1.
(Note: The unzipped folder might be named StudyZone-1.0.0 or similar, depending on how your system unzips the file.)

Click "Select Folder" (or "Open," depending on your operating system).

Step 3: Verify Installation
The StudyZone extension should now appear in your list of installed extensions. Success! üéâ

You will likely see a yellow warning banner at the top of your Chrome browser window that says something like: "Disable developer mode extensions." This is a standard notification for extensions installed this way and cannot be removed. To keep StudyZone running, it's crucial that you DO NOT click "Disable" on this banner.
(Visual Aid: This yellow bar will be visible at the top)

üéØ How to Use StudyZone: Your Path to Focus
Once installed, setting up StudyZone is quick and easy:

Set Your Study Keywords:

Click on the StudyZone extension icon in your Chrome toolbar (it might be hidden behind the puzzle piece icon üß©).

A small popup will appear. In the text area, enter keywords related to your study topics. Separate each keyword with a comma (e.g., DSA, Algorithms, React, Python, Machine Learning).

Click the "Save Settings" button.

These keywords are vital! StudyZone uses them to identify and categorize videos as "study-related."

Browse YouTube with Confidence!

Navigate to YouTube as you normally would.

Shorts Blocking: If you click on any YouTube Shorts video, StudyZone will automatically redirect you back to the YouTube homepage, helping you avoid that rabbit hole!

Distraction Warnings: If you click on a regular video that appears to be entertainment content (and not related to your study keywords), a warning popup will appear. You'll have two choices:

"Go Back to Study": This will take you directly to the YouTube homepage, helping you refocus.

"Proceed Anyway": If you're truly done studying or want to watch the video, you can dismiss the warning.

Study Success! If you click on a video that matches your defined study keywords, you'll briefly see a satisfying "Well done! You're in the StudyZone!" message. Keep up the great work!

‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes & Troubleshooting
Please be aware of these points when using the free version of StudyZone:

No Automatic Updates: This free version will not update automatically. If I release new versions with bug fixes, improvements, or new features, you will need to manually download the new .zip file from the GitHub releases page, remove the old extension from chrome://extensions, and then "Load unpacked" the new one.

Persistent Developer Mode Warning: The "Disable developer mode extensions" banner will always be visible while the extension is installed in developer mode. This is a standard Chrome security notice for extensions not from the official Web Store.

Security: Always exercise caution! Only install extensions from sources you trust. Since this is not from the Chrome Web Store, Google's automatic security checks are bypassed.

Got questions, found a bug, or have a brilliant idea for a new feature?

Happy Studying! üöÄ
