StudyZone Chrome Extension
üìö About StudyZone
The StudyZone Chrome Extension is designed to help you stay focused on your studies by minimizing distractions on YouTube. It works by:

Blocking YouTube Shorts: Automatically redirects you from Shorts videos to the YouTube homepage.

Warning for Entertainment Content: If you're on a YouTube video page that appears to be entertainment-related (based on common entertainment keywords), a popup will warn you, reminding you of your study goals and giving you the option to go back to the YouTube homepage.

"Well Done" Message for Study Content: When you visit a video that matches your defined study keywords, you'll see a quick "Well done! You're in the StudyZone" message to encourage your focus.

This extension helps you create a more productive browsing environment, keeping you on track with your learning objectives!

üöÄ How to Install StudyZone (Free Version)
Since this extension is not available on the Chrome Web Store, you'll need to install it manually using Chrome's "Developer mode." Follow these steps carefully:

Step 1: Download the Extension Files

Download the latest version of the StudyZone extension:
Click this link to download the zipped extension folder:
https://github.com/yash88990/StudyZone.zip/archive/refs/tags/v1.0.0.zip

Once downloaded, find the StudyZone.zip file on your computer (it's usually in your "Downloads" folder).

Unzip the StudyZone.zip file. This will create a new folder named StudyZone (or similar) containing all the extension's files.
It's very important to remember the exact location of this unzipped folder, as Chrome needs continuous access to it to run the extension. Do not delete or move this folder after installation.

Step 2: Load the Extension in Google Chrome

Open your Google Chrome browser.

In the address bar at the top, type chrome://extensions and press Enter.

On the Extensions page, look for a toggle switch in the top right corner labeled "Developer mode". Click this switch to turn it ON.

Once "Developer mode" is on, you will see a new button appear on the left side of the page: "Load unpacked". Click this button.

A file browser window will open. Navigate to and select the unzipped StudyZone folder you created in Step 1.

Click "Select Folder" (or "Open," depending on your operating system).

Step 3: Verify Installation

The StudyZone extension should now appear in your list of installed extensions.

You will likely see a yellow warning banner at the top of your Chrome browser window that says something like: "Disable developer mode extensions." This is normal for extensions installed this way and cannot be removed. To keep the extension running, you must NOT click "Disable" on this banner.

üí° How to Use StudyZone
Set Your Study Keywords:

Click on the StudyZone extension icon in your Chrome toolbar (it might be hidden behind the puzzle piece icon).

A small popup will appear. In the text area, enter keywords related to your study topics, separated by commas (e.g., DSA, Algorithms, React, Python).

Click "Save Settings".

These keywords will be used to identify study-related videos.

Browse YouTube:

Navigate to YouTube as usual.

If you click on a YouTube Shorts video, the extension will automatically redirect you to the YouTube homepage.

If you click on a regular video that appears to be entertainment content (and not related to your study keywords), a warning popup will appear. You can choose to "Go Back to Study" (which takes you to the YouTube homepage) or "Proceed Anyway."

If you click on a video that matches your study keywords, you'll briefly see a "Well done! You're in the StudyZone" message.

‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes
No Automatic Updates: This free version of the extension will not update automatically. If I release new versions with bug fixes or features, you will need to manually download the new .zip file, remove the old extension from chrome://extensions, and "Load unpacked" the new one.

Persistent Warning: The "Disable developer mode extensions" banner will always be visible while the extension is installed in developer mode. This is a standard Chrome security notice for extensions not installed from the official Web Store.

Security: Only install extensions from sources you trust. Since this is not from the Chrome Web Store, Google's automatic security checks are bypassed.
